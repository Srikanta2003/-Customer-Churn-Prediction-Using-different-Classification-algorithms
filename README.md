 #Customer Churn Prediction Using different Classification algorithms | 
 • Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the data with 21 columns and 7K rows using matplotlib.
 • Implemented SMOTE to transform the previously imbalanced dataset to a balanced one.
 • Applied different algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN and SVM
 to the Training Data.
 • Compared different models based on their Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score values on the
 Testing data.
